# Bézier Curve Tool

A simple tool for drawing curves on a HTML5 Canvas and outputting the SVG path specification using cubic Bézier curves.

## Why?

I was trying to create some simple shapes in SVG by hand, and I just couldn't get my head around where to place the control points to get the curves I wanted. After a fair bit of trial and error, I decided to build this tool to help me understand better.

## Built using

Vue.js and HTML5 Canvas API.
